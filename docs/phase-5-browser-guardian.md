# Phase 5: Browser Guardian and cross-surface provenance

Browser Guardian is a controlled Playwright/Chromium research harness. It is not a universal interceptor for arbitrary browser processes. Browser activity is protected when the agent uses this harness, just as MCP activity is protected when the client uses the Guardian proxy.

## Protected boundary

The harness captures page origin, title, rendered text, DOM-ingested text, frames, links, forms, and network destinations. It compares rendered text with agent-ingested DOM text so hidden content remains attributable to its page.

The following operations are checked before their side effect:

- navigation;
- form submission;
- credential entry;
- purchases;
- downloads;
- non-read network requests, fetches, XHR, and WebSockets;
- browser-influenced system execution.

`ALLOW` proceeds, while `ASK` is held unless the embedding application supplies an approval callback. `BLOCK` never proceeds. The default CLI does not auto-approve held actions.

## Running an observation

Install Chromium once after installing dependencies:

```text
npx playwright install chromium
```

Run the controlled browser:

```text
agent-guardian-browser --url https://example.test --session demo-1
```

Use `--trusted-origin https://example.test` for a controlled origin, `--storage <directory>` to share a non-default Guardian store, and `--headed` to show the browser window.

## Cross-surface enforcement

Browser events are appended to `cross-surface-events.jsonl` in the Guardian storage directory. Records are ordered and SHA-256 hash chained. Invalid JSON, changed records, broken ordering, or broken links fail integrity verification.

The MCP proxy reads the same trace for the same session ID:

- exact browser-text reuse is recorded as `exact-fingerprint` influence;
- transformed or summarized content uses bounded `coarse-session-taint`;
- untrusted browser content influencing an MCP write triggers R8 and requires approval;
- untrusted browser content influencing system execution triggers R7 and is blocked;
- trusted benign content does not trigger those rules merely because it came from a browser.

The browser and MCP calls must use the same session identifier for cross-surface correlation.

## Reproducible twins

The test suite includes two self-hosted pages:

- a benign report with an expected form action;
- a visually similar report containing hidden prompt-injection text.

The Chromium integration test proves that the benign form can proceed and that the poisoned form is held before the HTTP submission reaches the local server.
